# The Gateway API provides more advanced routing capabilities than Ingress, including:
- Multi-protocol support (HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
- Better extensibility with Routes and Filters
- More granular access control using AllowedRoutes.Unlike Ingress, which is primarily HTTP-based, Gateway API is designed for flexibility across multiple protocols.
